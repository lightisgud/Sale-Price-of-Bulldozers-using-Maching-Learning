# Sale-Price-of-Bulldozers-using-Maching-Learning
In the notebook, we're going to go through an example of machine learning project by predicting the future sale price of a bulldozer, given its characteristics and previous examples of how much similar bulldozer has been sold for and the goal is to build a machine learning model to minimize RMSLE (root mean squared log error).
